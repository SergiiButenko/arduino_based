Jenkins-Light
=============
Jenkins-Light enables communication to a physical continuous-integration traffic light using an Arduino board to display the status of a Jenkins-CI server.

Included is the Arduino sketch and a Python script that queries Jenkins and sends a signal to the Arduino board to display status.


Arduino Setup
-------------
The Arduino sketch file can be found in the arduino/ directory.

The sketch is designed to blink a set of red, yellow, or green lights depending on the signal sent from the host PC through serial communication. A byte corresponding to the ASCII character 'r' turns on the red pattern, 'y' for yellow, and 'g' for the green pattern. The light LED should connect directly to the digital output pins on your arduino board.


Python Setup
-------------
The jenkins-light.py script creates a serial connection with the arduino board. It then queries the Jenkins-CI server for status and send the signal to the arduino board. 

The script must be configured to point to the Jenkins host address, and the Serial USB path must be configured as well. Both values are set at the top of the script.


PYTHON DEPENDENCIES
-------------
* Tested using Python 2.7
* [jenkinsapi](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/jenkinsapi)
